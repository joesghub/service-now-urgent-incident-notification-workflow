## AI Scenario
*How AI agents could enhance incident routing (100-150 words)*

**Hypothetical Scenario**
Your company operates globally across multiple time zones. Critical incidents often occur outside business hours when senior engineers aren't available. The current escalation process follows a rigid hierarchy that doesn't account for engineer expertise, current availability, or incident complexity, leading to prolonged resolution times.

**Explain how an AI agent could enhance your incident notification system to:**
- Intelligently route incidents based on engineer expertise and availability
- Consider time zones and current workloads when selecting responders
- Learn from historical resolution patterns to improve future routing decisions
